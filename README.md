# [Bedrock demo](https://bedrock.remarkable.dev)

## Requirements

Before running Statamic, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). In addition, we recommend [installing Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Installation instructions

1. Install composer dependencies: `composer install`
2. Install NPM dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a Statamic user: `php please make:user`
4. Start Laravel's local dev server, npm run dev, start queue: `composer run dev`

Once you have started the Artisan development server, the website will be accessible in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Head to [http://localhost:8000/cp](http://localhost:8000/cp) and use your email address and password to sign into the Statamic control panel.

## Tools, libraries and addons used in the project
- [Statamic](https://statamic.dev/) - Flat file Laravel CMS.
- [Antlers](https://statamic.dev/new-antlers-parser) - Templating engine provided with Statamic.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Utility-first CSS framework.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here) - Rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup.
- [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com) - A lightweight carousel library with fluid motion and great swipe precision.

## Views folder structure

│   └── alpine/                  # Alpine.js specific partials (e.g. if using Statamic REST API to load more entries)

## Tailwind CSS config
- `config.css` - site's config. This file would typically include custom config for the project.
- `typography.css` - the Tailwind CSS typography config for customizing the prose class.

## CLI commands
There is a nice list of custom scripts available in the command line to make a developer's job easier and more enjoyable.

### Blocks
Blocks are like LEGO bricks that provide you the maximum flexibility when building pages. Blocks are based on [Replicator Fieldtype](https://statamic.dev/fieldtypes/replicator).

#### Add
`php please make:block`

- Adds a set to the Blocks field in `resources/fieldsets/blocks.yaml`.
- Creates a fieldset for a block in `resources/fieldsets/{file_name}.yaml`.
- Creates a partial with default markup in `resources/views/blocks/{file-name}.antlers.html`.

#### Remove
`php please delete:block`

Removes a set from the Blocks field and all associated files.

### Sets
Sets provide a powerful content creation experience with unparalleled flexibility for building entries i.e., Blog posts. Sets live in the the Article field which is based on [Bard Fieldtype](https://statamic.dev/fieldtypes/bard).

#### Add
`php please make:set`

- Adds a set to the Article in `resources/fieldsets/article.yaml`.
- Creates a fieldset for a set in `resources/fieldsets/{file_name}.yaml`.
- Creates a set partial with default markup in `resources/views/sets/{file-name}.antlers.html`.

#### Remove
`php please delete:set`

Removes a set from the Article and all associated files.

## Production env file contents
Dump your `.env` values here with sensitive data removed. The following is a production example that uses full static caching:

```env

DEBUGBAR_ENABLED=false
```

## NGINX config
When using full static caching strategy you will need to [configure server rewrite rules](https://statamic.dev/static-caching#nginx).

To enable resource caching add the following to your NGINX config __inside the server block__:
```
expires $expires;
```

And this __outside the server block__:
```
map $sent_http_content_type $expires {
    default    off;
    text/css    max;
    ~image/    max;
    font/woff2    max;
    application/javascript    max;
    application/octet-stream    max;
}
```
