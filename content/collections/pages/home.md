Our maximum allowable size by virtue of the wisdom of County Regulations is just 5,000 cases. That means that even as we grow to full capacity, we are going to remain committed to our Elliptical Members '

            aside: 'Most wineries barrel or tank age their wines for a year or less on average before going to bottle. This quick & early bottling makes it relatively easy to respond to the vagaries of supply & demand. Need more wine? Just bottle it! Have too much inventory? Why, just make a deal with a big chain store. At worst, wineries with “normal” aging programs can quickly produce & bottle more wine within a year of the next harvest.'

            text: 'And, oh yes, another bit of stupidity is that for each additional year we stay in barrel we lose about 8% of our wine to evaporation—meaning that by the time we slide the wine into bottles, we’ve lost roughly a quarter of it in the form of the proverbial “angels’ share”—fumes to be enjoyed by those besotted winged beings that can be heard giggling in the darkened corners of our barrel room.'
