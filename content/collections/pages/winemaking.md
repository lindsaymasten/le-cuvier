            text: "“When asked to divulge\_the most important and influential factors that shape the wines of Le Cuvier John is quick to defer credit back to the vineyards. All of the grapes used in the wines of Le Cuvier come from specifically selected vineyard sites on the west side of Paso Robles. These sites are almost all head trained, dry farmed, and organic, many with an average vine age of 20–30 years and extremely low standard yields. Harvest typically takes place at sugar levels between 24–25 brix resulting in potential alcohol levels of around 14%, which is on the low-end for warm sun-drenched Paso Robles.”"
