            text: 'We ferment our reds and our whites in low profile open top tanks that have an approximate ratio of being 2 times as wide as tall (four foot high by eight foot wide). The white grapes are fermented on their skins just like the red grapes, and the main difference between red and white wines is that the whites typically enjoy four years or longer in barrel, rather than the three years typical for red wine aging.'

            text: 'The low-profile tank approach, though terribly inefficient in terms of square footage of floor space required per ton of grapes processed, results in quick extraction of color, flavor & fine tannins from the skins. As a result, we typically gravity drain the fermenting juice to barrel at roughly 1/3 of the way through fermentation. Thus, all of our wines, both red and white, are essentially barrel fermented.'

            text: 'The press fraction, which is roughly 10% by volume, also racks by gravity to barrel, but the press fraction is kept separate from the free-run wine until blending decisions are made. Blending typically does not begin for at least two years post-harvest, so we are able to decide whether or not to include press fraction wine in our blends.'

            text: "In terms of sulfite, it has been our long-term observation that wines made without use of sulfite have much lower potential for oxidation than is the case with wines made using sulfite. Though this is counterintuitive, we have a large wine library that supports our contention that wines made in this manner age well beyond 25 years to significant benefit. In addition, we believe that a broader array of yeast types and other microorganisms participate in the fermentation and during the long barrel aging of our wines to significant advantage, specifically resulting in a much broader spectrum of flavors and aromas by comparison\_"

            text: "“When asked to divulge\_the most important and influential factors that shape the wines of Le Cuvier John is quick to defer credit back to the vineyards. All of the grapes used in the wines of Le Cuvier come from specifically selected vineyard sites on the west side of Paso Robles. These sites are almost all head trained, dry farmed, and organic, many with an average vine age of 20–30 years and extremely low standard yields. Harvest typically takes place at sugar levels between 24–25 brix resulting in potential alcohol levels of around 14%, which is on the low-end for warm sun-drenched Paso Robles.”"
