        text: 'Traditional marketing funnels often focus solely on the initial sale, but true success comes from understanding the entire customer journey. By mapping every stage of interaction—from the first brand introduction to repeat purchases—marketers can identify what inspires, frustrates, and influences customers. Start by analyzing data, conducting interviews, and observing user behavior. Then, transform these insights into a visual roadmap that highlights touchpoints, motivations, and pain points. The result is a blueprint for more personalized messaging, improved customer experiences, and higher long-term retention.'
