  Ingredients for Assembling the Tacos
  - 12 small corn or flour tortillas
  - 1 cup shredded purple cabbage

instructions: |-
  Season the short ribs generously with salt and pepper.

  In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

  Sear the short ribs on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side, remove from the skillet and set aside.

  In the same skillet or Dutch oven, add the diced onion and garlic. Cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the coffee, cocoa powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Cook for another minute until fragrant. Pour in the beef broth and lime juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

  Return the short ribs to the skillet, nestling them into the liquid.

  Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet or Dutch oven, and let the short ribs simmer gently for

  2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. Check occasionally and add more

  broth if needed to keep the ribs partially submerged.

  Once the short ribs are tender, remove them from the skillet and shred the meat using two forks.

  Discard any bones and excess fat.

  Toast or fry the tortillas and set aside.

  To each tortilla add 1 tbsp of smashed avocado, 1 oz of beef, a small mound of purple cabbage, top with lime crema, pickled red onion & cilantro microgreens. Serve each taco with a lime wedge.
