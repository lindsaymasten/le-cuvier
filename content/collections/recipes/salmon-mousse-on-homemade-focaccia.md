  note: this portion of the recipe is for baking at low altitude or sea level using the metric system, autolyse & poolish methods

  baking sheet size 13”W x 18”L x 1”H

  500 g all purpose flour

  360 g 100°F water

  10.5 g sea salt

  2 g active dry yeast

  1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil + 2 Tbsp to coat baking sheet

  Using a stand mixer with dough hook attachment mix flour and water until it forms a dough ball, about 5 minutes. Once formed cover with clean flour sack towel and let rest for at least 30 minutes. Next, mix in sea salt and yeast. Incorporate ingredients well using dough hook and mixer, about 5 minutes. Make your first fold 10 minutes after mixing the dough. Make your second fold 35 minutes after the first fold. Once the second fold is complete cover and leave to bulk ferment until the dough has doubled in size, about 4 hours. This will complete the bulk fermentation process.

  Preheat oven to 500°F. 

  Use three tablespoons of olive oil to coat the baking sheet and form dough to your pan. The dough should be about 3/4 inch thick and look like a rectangular pizza. Cover and rest dough again for proofing, about 1 hour. Once proofed, dimple the dough with your fingers and cover with 1/8 cup of olive oil. (Use more or less oil to your liking). Bake in 500 degree oven for 20 minutes or until bread has browned and crisped.

  For the salmon mousse:

  1 Tbps extra virgin olive oil

  4 oz. ora king salmon | skin on

  8 oz. cream cheese | at room temperature

  1 tsp dill | chopped

  1 lemon | juiced (zest first and reserve for garnish)

  salt & pepper to taste

  Reduce oven heat to 350°F.

  Pan sear salmon skin side down for 3 minutes in a cast iron pan. Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake uncovered for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.

  Remove skin and enjoy as an appetizer or discard. Add salmon meat, dill, lemon juice, salt & pepper to a blender and process until smooth. Transfer mix to a piping bag fitted with an open star piping tip and set aside.

  For the tangerine “caviar” pearls:

  (can be made up to one day in advance)

  1/3 cup unpasteurized tangerine juice

  + 1 cup for storing pearls

  1/4 tsp agar agar powder

  1 cup neutral oil | chilled

  Pour 1 cup neural oil into a tall glass and chill.

  In a small saucepan bring 1/3 cup tangerine juice to boil, reduce heat, add 1/4 teaspoon agar agar powder and simmer for 1-2 minutes until the powder is dissolved and there are no clumps. Remove from heat and let it cool for 3-5 minutes. Fill an oral syringe or small squeeze bottle with juice mix and squeeze one drop at a time into the cold oil. Little pearls will form on contact with the cold oil. Strain using a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth and store in 1 cup of tangerine juice until ready to use.

  To garnish:

  1 Tbsp dill | small fronds

  1 english cucumber | cut into ribbons,

  sliced once in half lengthwise and sliced again into 4 inch long strips

  zest from the lemon juiced for the salmon mousse

  Cut focaccia into two inch squares. Using an open star piping tip and bag, pipe the salmon mousse onto the focaccia. Wrap cucumber (4 inch ribbons) around salmon mousse. Garnish with tangerine pearls, lemon zest, and a fresh dill frond.
