bio: |-
  Born and raised in Transylvania, the land of vampires which, for good reason, also has one of the highest per capita consumption of red wine in the world, Mika moved to the US (Los Angeles) in late 2003 with a struggling vocabulary (now clearly overcome) and a passion for learning. In 2005 she moved to San Luis Obispo in order to learn by doing at Cal Poly SLO, and her passion quickly migrated to the local wine industry in the early months of 2009.

  At Le Cuvier, Mika enjoys the dynamics of our fabulous team, the offered guests experiences, having an onsite commercial kitchen and pairings to brag about, as well as the fabulous hilltop view.

  Hobbies: Art, sea glass collecting, rainbow hunting
  Favorite part of the winemaking process: barrel fermentation.
  Favorite local restaurants: Goshi SLO, Novo, Robin’s, Mistura
  Favorite memory: picking Tannat from A vineyard in the Adelaida AVA
  Corky Trait: cooking too much food & expecting everyone else to eat it
  Favorite things about Le Cuvier: 1. The wine 2. The view 
  Favorite Variety: Cabernet Franc
